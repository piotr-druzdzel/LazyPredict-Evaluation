# LazyPredict-Evaluation
Testing LazyPredict's performance

LazyPredict is a convenient wrapper library, that enables us to quickly fit all the models to our dataset and compare their performance. This way, we can see what works well “out of the box”. However, this is not a silver bullet solution to model training and selection, as only the default variants are trained. And as we know, hyperparameter tuning can change the performance drastically.
